Ember-Py
========

Ember Playground.

Running
=======

Simply run ```python ember-py.py```. This will tell you what port flask is running on on your local machine.
Open that in your browser and you're good to go.

I would also recommend getting [Ember Inspector][1] for Chrome. Very nice tool for debugging Ember.
